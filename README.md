# Gomoku

This is a design of Gomoku game which is a popular chess game. 

This project includes two parts:
1. Design the game interface of Gomoku in order to virsualize the game process and to help users have a better game experience.
2. Design a Gomuku AI which can learn the rules of Gomoku by playing games with itself. I use reinforce learning technology to achieve the goal. 

Result:
1. The game interface is easy to use and supports "player vs computer" and "player vs player" models.
2. With machine learning algorithm, it can learn rules well after hundreds of rounds by playing with itself.

How to use:
1. Download all documents into a folder.
2. run "python gomoku.py" in the terminal.
